## MATLAB MINI PROJECT 

Our project is based on isolation of a circular object from the given image and measuring its radius and also calculating its diameter, area, and circumference.

•	It takes the image path as the input and converts it into a matrix that is (Rows x Columns x RGB) and uses the Image Processing Toolbox to identify and highlight the circles in the image within the preset radius range. Also, users can specify their own range of radius for circle detection.

•	 Two types of circles are identified based on their polarity: Bright circles and Dark circles. Their centers and radii are evaluated and stored.

•	Based on the radii matrix obtained, the diameter, area and circumference of the corresponding circles are calculated.

•	The graphical analysis of these parameters is displayed at the end which is able to accurately depict their variations with respect to the number of circles.

•	Our project has various real-life applications like finding the lost circular object, we can sort out the objects by their details such as their approx., counting cocci organisms, etc.
